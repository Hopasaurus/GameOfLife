Conway's Game of Life


Discussed this over lunch and came up with an idea to try.

First iteration will be an attempt at non-array version where neighbor counting is done via refs.


Current plan:

Time is constrained so will be running in three Pomodoro's to get effective use of time.

1. Project setup and start a cell class
2. Simple cell grid builder
3. Generation runner (move from current to next gen)
